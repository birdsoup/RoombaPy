#todo: low side drivers (both methods), send ir, song, play song, sensors, query list, stream, pause/resume stream, script, play script, show script, wait time, wait distance, wait angle
#todo: should document start and end state(mode) of each command
#todo: test the demo commands and see if they work
#todo: should write out the table of notes somewhere, not really sure how to represent this
